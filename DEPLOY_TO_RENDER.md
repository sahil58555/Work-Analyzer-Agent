- For dynamic file uploads, consider cloud storage integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Build Fails:**
- Check `requirements.txt` for invalid packages
- Verify Python version compatibility
- Review build logs in Render dashboard

**App Won't Start:**
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly
